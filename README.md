Make build directory and cd into it.
On Linux build using:
- cmake ..
- make

Call 'socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0' to set up a virtual UART port
- The second file is the writing port
- The first file is the reading port

To test the receiver, parser, and broadcaster:
- Inside the build/ directory, run ./test_imu {second file from from socat command}
- In another terminal, run ./TrueAnomalyAssessment {first file from socat command}
- In another terminal, run 'python3 Receiver.py' from within IMU_Driver directory

You should see the packet that was generated by 'test_imu', the exact data being received and parsed in 'TrueAnomalyAssessment', and the exact data received via socket in "Receiver.py"

Driver.py uses an extern Cpp file to generate fake data and prints it --> future iteration is to generate data, send it to UART port, and receive on socket to check if it is exactly what it expects
